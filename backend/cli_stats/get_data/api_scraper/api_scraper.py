"""***HOW TO USE***

    1. Create an instance of Football, this initiates the leagues dict which holds
    all the leagueIDs.

    fb = Football()

    2. To get the all the seasons for all leagues, first run the the method
    fb.load_leagues()
    this fills the leagues dict with nessesery info to make further querys.
    To get season values the league abbreviation has to be passed like below:

    fb.leagues['EN_PR'].load_seasons()

    This selects the key 'EN_PR' which is the parent key in leagues and loads
    the season for that league by running the method load.seasons() which is in
    class Leagues(). This returns a dict seasons holding the following:

    1992/93': {'competition': 1, 'id': 1, 'label': '1992/93'}

    Where the '1992/93' is the key containing that seasons information.


    ***WHAT IS NEEDED FOR ARBITRAIRY QUERYS***

    League abbreviation
    Season label
    Team name
